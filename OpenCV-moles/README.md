# Computer Vision for Skin Moles

This program uses OpenCV methods to identify, analyze and track the growth of moles on your skin. It keeps track of potentially cancerous moles with dead simple tracking and cataloging. The program shows the patient or user the "mole history" with the date and size of the mole on that date, allowing the user to keep track of the mole growth.

This project was conceived and developed at a tel aviv hackathon fellowship.
